## Inviting Corrections From Readers

Whether a typo or a more substantial error of fact, we invite readers to help us make appropriate corrections.

There is a direct and preferred way to suggest specific corrections. At the bottom of most pages is a “Suggest Changes” button. This button leads to a website where the content of the article can be directly edited after logging in with a free account. After making changes to the document, briefly note why these changes were made in the revision note, and select the option to create a “pull request.” We review and accept pull requests on a regular basis.

In some cases, before proposing specific corrections, it may be better to [create an “issue”](https://github.com/PeacefulScience/peacefulscience.org/issues) where a potential problem can be discussed.
