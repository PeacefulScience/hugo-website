# Ideas: Consequents and Antecedents

{{< amazon `B006IMMOVW` >}}

One of the most memorable book titles from the 20th century is Richard Weaver’s _Ideas Have Consequences_ (1948). One need not agree with Weaver’s analysis to adopt the title as a healthy credo, which reminds us that what is thought and expressed at one time influences what is thought and expressed elsewhere. However, as is true of all slogans, it tends to deemphasize important features in achieving its singular result. And the inverse—the importance of antecedents not consequences—strikes me as crucial in reflecting on Professor Livingstone’s plenary (“Tracking Adam’s Bloodline”). Ideas not only have downstream consequences but also upstream motivations. Attending to their diversity and heterogeneity, how they are implemented, and why it matters is paramount.

Livingstone’s argument can be seen as a précis of his 2008 book, _Adam’s Ancestors: Race, Religion and the Politics of Human Origins_ (Livingstone 2008). There he shows how investigations into the ancestry of Adam are shot through with a variety of provocations: grappling with scriptural references to pre-Adamite lineages, reckoning with “peoples” found in voyages of discovery (and stories about their monstrous variation), digesting divergent Chinese and Egyptian chronicles of human origins and a fossil record of (seemingly) deep time, and jousting with biblical criticism that called into question the authorship and exegesis of early chapters of Genesis (among other passages). The significance of these provocations was always gaged in terms of prior motivations, whether to preserve a literal reading of Adam for soteriological reasons, negotiate the juncture between orthodox exegesis and textual analysis, undermine theological appeals to secularize history, or justify a conception of racial hierarchy.

This latter motivation was all too present in most accounts, even in those that directly contradicted one another (and long before evolutionary perspectives predominated). That is, those who argued _against_ pre-Adamite lineages often invoked it in support of the reality of racial difference and hierarchy just as often as those who argued _for_ pre-Adamite lineages. Much of this argumentation urged that the very idea of pre-Adamites had theological consequences and scientific implications (e.g., accounting for the origin of language), as well as moral and political ramifications (e.g., the nature of human rights). Yet there was a binding motivational tie among many of them, a tie reminding us that tracking serves other ends than just ascertaining what really happened. Those in favor of pre-Adamite lineages pointed to the pluralist origin of humans and the “natural” racial divide that followed from this “fact.” Those against claimed moral high ground in keeping humanity unified but then marshaled arguments about how differences of climate and processes of postlapsarian degeneration differentiated the races (and not equally). Defenders of the slave trade could be found on both sides: “scientific anthropology bestialized slavery; adamic theology sanctified it” (Livingstone 2008, 182). The links between good science, orthodox theology, and morality were (and are) tangled and knotted in complex ways.

A deep insight of Livingstone’s historical narrative (one of many) is the identification and characterization of this shared motivation and its enduring nature through long periods of history (and arguably its increasing manifestation).[^1] Cultural politics of racial hierarchies with white Europeans presumed as the pinnacle were ubiquitous.[^2] This endurance extends to today and perhaps is easier for us to recognize considering recent political trends in the United States. But we should not let politics distract us from the impact of this endurance on current forms of biological investigation. Racial typologies pervade contemporary genetics and genomics, infusing biomedicine and social science in a problematic fashion.[^3]

[^2]: “The question of human origins was not simply about science and species; it was about society and sex, cultural identity and racial purity. Bloodlines matter economically, politically, spiritually. Labor economics, voting rights, marriage laws, church membership all were fold into the passion to determine just who was, and who was not, of Adam’s lineage” (Livingstone 2008, 169).

# Tracking Methods

Attending to motivations for tracking Adam’s bloodline is important because these guide and animate different methods of tracking, weightings of which methods take precedent or have evidential heft, and distinct conceptions of what is being tracked. Take the example of mitochondrial Eve (mtEve). The use of maternally inherited DNA from mitochondria processed with phylogenetic algorithms tracked matrilineality. However, motivations burst through the skeleton of inquiry as researchers drew attention to their “discovery” by labeling it with biblical imagery and then saw mtEve re-produced through a diversity of social and political lenses, a process they contributed to liberally.[^4] A similar pattern is observable for ‘Y-chromosome’ Adam (YchAdam) where patrilineality is tracked, though with a different item (nuclear DNA) exhibiting different properties (e.g., mtDNA has 16,000 base pairs and a greater mutation rate than the 60 million base pairs of the Y chromosome).

[^4]: “Controversy with respect to Wilson's marketing of mtEve, together with debates about the inference itself, contributed to her establishment as a specific imaginary ancestor in the scientific literature, especially since scientists (Cann, Stoneking, and Wilson, included) appealed to popular representations of mtEve and the ‘out of Africa’ hypothesis in subsequent scholarly publications and debates” (DiMarco 2020, 7).

The tracking methods for both mtEve and YchAdam are genetic. What is being tracked? Matrilineality and patrilineality. However, notice this genetic evidence yields a distinct type of conclusion: specific genealogy within a species. Josh Swamidass has demonstrated how routine appeals to genetic ancestry, whether in terms of mitochondrial or nuclear DNA, are distinct from claims of genealogical ancestry.[^5] Given that specific elements of genetic evidence for direct ancestry (parent to offspring) dilute over time (halving each generation), they are not well suited to establishing a claim of universal ancestry within a species. Universal common descent within a species is not relevant for most evolutionary biology because it is focused on populations and has no reason to isolate individual organisms in the past or establish the “_true_ and _complete_ web of biological parentage”[^6]—universal genealogical ancestors are ubiquitous and uninteresting. I think we can enrich the vocabulary related to this crucial distinction because different tracking methods focus on different claims of ancestry, relate different items genealogically, and involve different types of evidence that have an impact on what can be concluded (Table 1).

**Table 1**

In addition to subtleties of tracking methods, there is a logic behind them worth noticing. Scientific practices of tracking involve proxies—measurements of specific properties that stand in for something else. Biologists use subsets of characters (parts), such as genomic sequences, and their differing states to follow organisms or lineages (wholes). In genomic analyses, some parts exhibit desirable properties to support inferences, such as the exclusive maternal inheritance of mitochondrial DNA, which then serve as proxies for the lineages studied, frequently in the absence of other parts (e.g., skeletal remains or cultural artifacts). When single characters are taken to represent a lineage, they are often reified as exemplifying the nature of the thing they represent. What it means to be “human” in many of these tracking methods is to have a particular complement of DNA and, by way of a positive, justificatory feedback loop, encourages more inferences about lineages (i.e., bloodlines) in terms of these proxies.

#  Why It Matters

Why should we care about the mixed motives and the multiplicity of methods exhibited in attempts to track Adam’s bloodline? Clearly Livingstone pulls up the rug to show the darker side of motivations, such as those of white supremacist groups that pertain to concerns about “race-mixing” and foster a denial of the humanity of non-Adamic lineages. More broadly, I see two key reasons why it matters. First, it directs our attention to what drives our fascination with these questions: identity. What does it mean to be “human”?[^7] Theological answers that emphasize the _imago dei_ (whether attributes or role) seem radically divergent from genealogical continuity or the ability to interbreed (as the biological species concept would suggest). Scientific stories are empirically grounded though complicated and open to interpretation: which concept of species should we adopt?[^8] More concerning (to many) is that these membership conditions are a thin gruel with respect to meaning and significance. There isn’t much to work with in fashioning an account of who we are based on material continuity alone. The theological answers are also subject to different interpretations and difficult to pin down empirically, but their attractiveness (and controversial status) lies in the robustness of the accounts, whether in terms of our mission in the world or expectation for a relational existence. Questions of identity are deeply motivational.

Second, mixed motives and multiple tracking methods reveal what is often at stake in controversies about identity questions: credibility and authority. Do scientific and theological claims have credibility and, if so, do they merit equal or differential authority? Here we enter a broader space and therefore need only note that attempts to find harmony or discord among scriptural and scientific claims function, as Livingstone describes, “as a kind of mold which sculpt[s] both scientific commitment and theological conviction into a distinctive shape ... agents actively fashioning both scientific theory and religious doctrine into new forms”.[^9] Although it is often assumed that credibility (and by implication authority) lies with the sciences in our current moment, the fact that scientists working on human ancestry invoked names from sacred texts indicates that the authority to be heard and appreciated (rather than just funded) lies with the broader public, something recent science communication is grappling with in the wake of the deficit model’s demise.[^10]

In this respect, we need to expand Steven Shapin’s (2010) cheeky subtitle into a full-blown mantra: we should study science and theology as if they were produced by people with bodies, situated in time, space, culture, and society, and struggling for credibility and authority. Perhaps it is more poignant when talking about Adam’s bloodline to be reminded of Shapin’s main title: _never pure_. The phrase “Adam’s blood ran in every human vein” cannot be taken literally (blood is not transferred across generations). Bloodline is a metaphorical notion associated with lineages that frequently operates as a palimpsest. This is not a denial of Weaver’s titular slogan: the ideas under discussion in these debates have consequences. However, upstream motivations should not be ignored. If, as Livingstone claims, “the mission to track Adam’s bloodline must surely rank as the archetypal quest of Western culture,”[^11] then we need to scrutinize the motivations at work in those who undertake the quest. Jaroslav Pelikan showed that images of Jesus reflected contemporaneous values and concerns at different historical and cultural junctures;[^12] our efforts to track Adam’s bloodline may ultimately reflect back to us more than we want to know about ourselves.
