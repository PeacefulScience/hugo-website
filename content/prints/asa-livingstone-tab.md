Thanks to commentators for their thoughtful and insight set of reflections. 

## Hans Madeume

Good to see you again Hans. I see you’re still looking for David Livingstone!  This is Hans’s second attempt, he tells me. I guess I might have to say “Third time lucky”!

Not surprisingly as a theologian, Hans is looking for something normative, something prescriptive, out of my historical reflections. And he is on a hermeneutic quest to pin down the beliefs of the author. Fair enough. The question is why does he want to do this?  Why would the personal opinions of a mere historian matter?

A couple of questions for Hans by way of reply.  Suppose he could classify me as one those within what he calls the ‘demythologizing Adam’ project, what difference _would_ this make to how he reads the narrative I have presented? What difference _should_ it make? How would it change his observation that the historical case studies I presented “reveal how different protagonists ‘invented’ or ‘constructed’ their own Adams to suit their ideological purposes”? On the other hand, suppose I join him as a “dinosaur in the second camp”? Would I now have moved from the position of being an opponent to being an ally in Hans’s cause?  What difference would that make to how he interprets the narrative I have presented.  And of course, it could be that I haven’t made up my mind on which team to support. What then?

All of this is a way of asking what difference classifying the historian makes to Hans’s hermeneutics. Like definitions, classifications wield cultural power.  They police scholarship by determining who is in or out of some hermeneutic circle. One thing I am convinced of is, though, that whatever side anyone takes on Hans’s classification, all need to be made more aware of the darker side and the complications of the Adamic story, and its ongoing legacy.

## Joshua Swamidass

I’m very grateful for Josh’s reflections. I confess I haven’t followed the literature on genetic bottlenecks and I’m interested to hear what he has to say on that subject.

Let me just dwell on one point.  Josh has entitled his response “Evolution Vindicates Monogenesis”. He makes the observation – and I quote – “For centuries the Church stood against racist theories of origins with a confession of monogenesis: ‘we are all descended from Adam and Eve’.”  “But now’, Josh is pleased to report, “in an epic twist, it is evolutionary science that vindicates the doctrine of monogenesis”. Josh is sure that there is theological significance in this recent twist, but he also welcomes it from the perspective of rebuilding a Christian voice on race and contributing to his own concerns about “ race and justice in a fallen world”. He says this even while conceding that monogenism can be racist. Yes indeed. 

I’d like to focus on this aspect of Josh’s contributions as the story here is complicated too.

First: Evolution and Monogenesis. The relationship between evolution and monogenism has never been clear cut. We need to recall that polygenism long persisted within the evolutionary paradigm.  Thomas Henry Huxley, for example, saw Darwin’s theory of natural selection as reconciling and combining “all that is good in the Monogenetic and Polygenetic schools” (1865).  The ‘good’ he saw in polygenism was the recognition of irreversible difference and inequality of the races. Indeed, my good friend, Nicolaas Rupke, a highly distinguished historian of science, once told me that he first encountered polygenism _within_ evolutionary theory. Given this, and given the multi-regional hypothesis of human origins (as opposed to the Noah’s Ark theory) championed by Milford Walpoff and Alan Thorne, it’s clear that there remained a lot of polygenetic thinking within evolutionary theory. I should add that these latter advocates of polygenism argued that polygenism did not necessarily equate with racism.

There are troubled waters here. Take the recent spat in the journal _Science_ over the 150th anniversary of Darwin’s _Descent of Man_. In an editorial for May 2021, the Princeton Anthropologist Augustín Fuentes lauded Darwin’s achievement, but paused to draw attention to the racism inherent in the volume.  He had in mind Darwin’s portrayals of the indigenous peoples of America and Australia as having less capacity than Europeans, and the ways in which Darwinian language was used to justify imperialism and colonialism. The subsequent letters the journal received from a number of high profile scientists, including Jerry Coyne, Sir Walter Bodmer and others, disclosed great dissatisfaction with Fuentes’s judgments. Among their concerns was the fear that his exposition would “encourage a spectrum of anti-evolution voices” and thereby damage the next generation of evolutionary scientists. 

Second, Christianity and Monogenism.  Again, not straightforward. Josh hopes that what I’ll call the new monogenism may combat racism and reassert the belief that “we are all bound together” as the “sons and daughters” of Adam and Eve. That we are all “one blood, one family, one race”. Racial equality and justice, however, haven’t simply followed from that doctrine. Take the rank racism of Christian slaveholders in the Old South despite their staunch resistance to the polygenetic anthropology of Nott, Gliddon and Agassiz and their robust defence of universal descent from Adam and Eve.   A number of conservative theologians published books with titles such as ‘The Christian Doctrine of Slavery’. People like Robert Dabney, George Armstrong and John Girardeau certainly thought polygenism and evolution were anti-biblical. But slavery wasn’t. To the contrary. They argued that slavery was endorsed in scripture, and they went through every verse in the bible that contained words like slave, love-slave, servant, servitude and the like.  These were never condemned. 

## Alan Love

Thanks Alan for that very astute set of observations.  I find myself in total agreement with your observations. Your foregrounding of the importance of motivations and methods seems exactly right to me, as do your thoughts on downstream and upstream consequences. I thoroughly approve of your comment that the “links between good science, orthodox theology, and morality were (and are) tangled and knotted in complex ways”.

I just want to add a thought on your emphasis on mixed motives. It turns out that ferreting out motivations can be a very tricky business, not least in the ‘cancel’ culture in which we currently live. Sensitivities on all sides make this a quagmire.  I’ve already mentioned in my response to Josh some prickliness in regard to comments on Darwin and race.  Let me stay in the same territory. Darwin’s uncle, Francis Galton, was a founder father of modern eugenics and developed regression analysis as a statistical means of examining what he considered to be degeneration in the quality of English families. Darwin’s son Leonard became President of the Eugenics Education Society, and another son, George, was a member of the Cambridge University Eugenics Society.  It turns out that Sir Ronald Fisher – a key architect of the “modern synthesis” that used mathematical models to integrate Mendelian genetics with Darwin’s selection theories - was mentored by Leonard Darwin.  He too was deeply committed to eugenics and it has been argued that that this was crucial to the fundamental contributions he made to genetics and to the development of modern neo-Darwinism.  Recall too that Theodosius Dobzhansky was a member of the Board of Directors of the American Eugenics Society. Is there a pattern here? No matter how you look at it, it seems that eugenics, Darwinism and genetics are closely intertwined. Figuring out motivations is vitally important, but far from straightforward.

There are pitfalls on every side here.  On the one hand, Ernst Mayr insisted that eugenics was merely contextual, not constitutive for the development of biological thinking, and therefore not part of evolution’s lofty intellectual genealogy. It could be left out of the mainstream story. On the other hand, Gonville and Gaius College Cambridge, under pressure from anti-racist activists, has removed a window commemorating the research of Sir Ronald Fisher.

## Conclusion

My commentators today have been kind.  And for that I am grateful, particularly for this kind of lecture.  Let me explain why.  Doing contextual history has been a rewarding experience for me. But  contextual history can be a struggle too.  Back in the late 1980s – before anyone was ‘woke’ – I was working on science, race and religion.  I recall presenting a paper at an academic conference where I quoted some pretty nasty racist comments by early nineteenth century anthropologists, and reproduced one or two images from their works.  By doing that I was accused by someone in the audience of reproducing racism.  I found this bizarre and tried to forget about it.  Then the American Philosophical Society refused to publish an 1830s or 40s image I wanted to use in a monograph on the subject on account of its offensiveness.  Again I found this strange as I was using the image to show how science (no less than religion) could be implicated in racist sentiments.

All of this goes to show that _finding_ the ‘fact of the matter’ and _communicating_ ‘the fact of the matter’ are equally problematic. It is a pure and simple truth that finding and communicating the truth is, to quote Oscar Wilde, from whom Steve Shapin got the title of the piece Alan mentioned, “rarely pure and never simple”.

Thank you.
