The historian Dr. Livingstone’s presents a synopsis of his excellent book, _Adam’s Ancestors_.[^1] This history is an exceedingly useful in undoing several false assumptions that cause conflict between evolution and orthodox Christian theology.

[^1]: David N Livingstone, _Adam’s Ancestors, Race, Religion, and the Politics of Human Origins_, 2008.

Towards greater ends, this history can also rebuild our theological voice on race. I am a dark-skinned Indian. The origins debate often seems like a frustrating internecine war between western Christian. But origins, I found, is caught up with my own concerns about race and justice in a fallen world. The questions of origins were how we struggled to make sense of the unity and diversity of humankind.

For centuries, the Church stood against racist theories of origins with a confession of monogenesis; “we all descend from Adam and Eve.” For centuries, scientist objected. Some theologians abandoned monogenesis. Others rejected evolution. But now, in an epic twist, evolutionary science vindicates monogenesis.

These questions guide my reading of both Livingstone’s history and the conversation between science and theology.
1. _Do we all descend from Adam and Eve?_ Theology hinges on this question, but was misunderstood in science.
2. _Did their lineage interbreed with others?_ Science hinges on this question, but it is a mystery in theology, an open question.
3. _What is human?_ This is central question of origins. But “human” is a term with multiple meanings. Scientists and theologians use the term in different ways.

# The Tradition of Monogenesis

In the monogenesis tradition of the Church, one of the demands of orthodoxy became, “we all descend from Adam and Eve.” This doctrine was crystalized in opposition to La Peyrere’s theory of polygenesis. In 1492, when Columbus sailed the ocean blue, he found a new continent with people living upon it. La Peyrere _incorrectly_ surmised that these new peoples could not possibly have descended from Adam and Eve. Appealing to Romans 5:12-14, La Peyrere’s suggested pre-Adamites as the explanation of co-Adamites in present day.

In response, most the Church rejected his premise. Ironically appealing to Romans 5:12-14 as well, they insisted these antipodeans, these humans in the New World, they were not actually co-Adamites. They, along with everyone else, also descend from Adam and Eve.

So, in historical context, the confession of monogenesis intends to reject the premise that some people in present day do _not_ descend from Adam and Eve.

Polygenesis, nonetheless, was taken up by scientists and colonialists, and it quickly metastasized into racist forms. Of course, monogenesis theories of origins can be just as racist too. But, in its confession of monogenesis, the Church found its voice against many racist theories of origins.

But what about the primordial past? Long ago, did Adam and Eve’s lineage interbreed with other lineages? The answer to _these_ questions is unclear.[^2] We find a lacuna, a gap, an inviting silence where speculation abounds.

[^2]: Several scholars, along with Livingstone too, demonstrate monogenesis allows for interbreeding. Kenneth W Kemp, [‘Science, Theology, and Monogenesis’](https://doi.org/10.5840/acpq201185213), _American Catholic Philosophical Quarterly_, 85.2 (2011), 217–36; Andrew Ter Ern Loke, [‘Reconciling Evolution and Biblical Literalism: A Proposed Research Program’](https://doi.org/10.1080/14746700.2016.1156328), _Theology and Science_, 2016; Antoine Suarez, [‘“Transmission at Generation”: Could Original Sin Have Happened at the Time When Homo Sapiens Already Had a Large Population Size?’](https://doi.org/10.12775/SetF.2016.014), _Scientia et Fides_, 4.1 (2016), 253.

**Figure 1. The monogenesis tradition of the Church rejects the existence of co-Adamites in present day.** The Genesis account has a great deal of mystery and open questions within that stimulated speculation of all sorts. The discovery of people in the New World challenged the account. La Peyrere proposed that they descended from pre-Adamites, but _not_ from Adam and Eve. The monogenesis tradition of the Church, instead, insisted that they also descended from Adam and Eve.

# Science Vindicates Monogenesis

Monogenesis was a theological conclusion, making an audacious claim about the world, one without any scientific backing. For centuries, scientists scoffed. Do we all descend from Adam and Eve? For centuries the answer was “no.” Recently, however, science recently changed its answer.

Now we know that Adam and Eve, if they were real people, would most likely be ancestors of us all. Even if they lived just 6,000 years ago, everyone across the globe would still descend from them by AD 1.[^3] We cannot “trace Adam’s lineage” with genetic evidence, but they would still most likely be genealogical ancestors of everyone. Maybe they were even specially created without parents.[^4]

[^3]: S. Joshua Swamidass, ‘The Overlooked Science of Genealogical Ancestry’, _Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith_, 70.1 (2018); Douglas L T Rohde, Steve Olson, and Joseph T Chang, [‘Modelling the Recent Common Ancestry of All Living Humans’](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature02842), _Nature_, 431.7008 (2004), 562–66.
[^4]: This is an equally important finding for a whole different set of theological and historical reasons that are, regrettably, beyond our scope here.

There is a catch. In the primordial past, Adam and Eve’s lineage must have interbred with others.[^5] The Genesis tradition is open-ended about this. So, science merely speaks where the tradition is silent, indicating that, long ago, Adam and Eve’s lineage interbred with others.

[^5]: If Adam and Eve’s lineage did _not_ interbreed with others, with a _long_ list of caveats, the genetic evidence seems to rule them out more recent than 500,000 years ago. More ancient than this might work, but maybe not. S. Joshua Swamidass, [‘Heliocentric Certainty Against a Bottleneck of Two?’](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1328247), 2018.

This is change to the scientific response to monogenesis might defuse centuries of conflict. For a long time, theologians insisted that the universe had a beginning. Scientists objected and scoffed. Then, about 100 years ago, the purely scientific theory of the Big Bang vindicated the theologians. In the same way, recent universal ancestry vindicates the monogenesis tradition.

# The Genetic Hammer

Evolutionary creationists at BioLogos are a helpful foil. They are very intent on arguing against monogenesis. The perceived conflict between evolution and monogenesis encourages the specific theological revisions they advocate.

## Our Ancestral Population Size Was Large

For the last decade, they proclaimed that the genetic evidence demonstrates our ancestral population size was never less than 10,000 individuals at any point in the last 18 million years. Therefore, Adam and Eve are _not_ ancestors of us all,[^6] and theology must be revised.

[^6]: [‘Evangelicals Question The Existence Of Adam And Eve’](https://www.npr.org/2011/08/09/138957812/evangelicals-question-the-existence-of-adam-and-eve), _National Pulbic Radio_, 2011; Richard N. Ostling, [‘The Search for the Historical Adam’](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2011/june/historicaladam.html), _Christianity Today_, 2011; Scott McKnight and Dennis R. Venema, _Adam and the Genome : Reading Scripture after Genetic Science_, 2017.

This is a garden path. The evidential claims about population size were just bad science.[^7] But even if they were true, Adam and Eve would still be ancestors of us all.

[^7]: Last month, several articles at BioLogos were deleted to remove these claims. Indefensibly, they also claim that their scientific conclusions are “unchanged.” S. Joshua Swamidass, [‘18 Million Years Ago Means...500,000?’](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/18-million-years-ago-means-500-000/13988), _Peaceful Science Forum_, 2021 [accessed 23 July 2021].

What was missed? They forgot to account for interbreeding between Adam and Eve’s lineage and others. People outside the garden, after all, are one of the great mysteries of the Genesis tradition.

**Figure 2. Large ancestral population sizes do not demonstrate that Adam and Eve were not ancestors of us all.** Even if our ancestral population was large, our best estimates indicate Adam and Eve would become ancestors of us all in about 4,000 years. They even could have been created de novo, without parents of their own.

## Ruling Out a Single-Couple Bottleneck

Last month, they published an updated argument:[^8] The genetic evidence rules out a “genetic bottleneck” of two individuals within the last 500,000 years. Therefore, Adam and Eve were not our “sole and unique” progenitors, and the “traditional” account of Adam and Eve must be revised.

[^8]: This is an article with scientific account that feeds into, an includes, BioLogos’s position statement on Adam and Eve. Stephen Schaffner, [‘What Genetics Says About Adam and Eve - Articles’](https://biologos.org/articles/what-genetics-say-about-adam-and-eve), _BioLogos_, 2021; BioLogos Foundation, ‘Were Adam and Eve Historical Figures?’](https://biologos.org/common-questions/human-origins/were-adam-and-eve-historical-figures).

The scientific account is technically valid.[^9] But an incorrect theological assumption quietly defines the inquiry. Outsized significance is bestowed upon an essentially unstudied niche of population genetics ... the esoteric “single-couple genetic bottleneck.”

[^9]: The science article concludes that genetic evidence rules out a single-couple genetic bottleneck more recent than 500,000 years ago. Based on the TMR4A data, most scientists will agree. Transspecies variation, however, may supersede this conclusion, pushing the date back father. Due to technical details out of scope of this paper, in my opinion, there is good reason to be skeptical of the site frequency spectrums (SFS) on which the article focuses.

Interbreeding was overlooked before, but this time it is ruled out from the outset with careful phrasing. This amounts to a theological assumption that the Genesis tradition unequivocally excludes interbreeding in primordial past. This assumption is hidden away in rigid definitions, thereby protected from scrutiny and debate.

The target is still monogenesis. In a telling omission, the scientific account does not explain that Adam and Eve _can_ be ancestors of us all. The science demonstrating this fact is also entirely omitted.[^10] This is ostensibly a review of “what genetic science says about Adam and Eve.” Such a material omission is indefensible, a misleading garden path again.

[^10]: Swamidass, ‘The Overlooked Science of Genealogical Ancestry’; S. Joshua Swamidass, [‘A Genelaogical Adam and Eve in Evolution’](http://henrycenter.tiu.edu/2017/06/a-genealogical-adam-and-eve-in-evolution/), _Sapientia_, 2017; Rohde, Olson, and Chang.

**Figure 3: Which of these two couples is the unique progenitors of humanity?** Is it the bottleneck couple or the headwater couple? Both are objectively unique by different criteria. If the black circles and squares depict humanity, it is a category error to think that the bottleneck couple are our sole progenitors. Instead, the headwater couple is. The headwater couple is the uniquely and solely located as the only progenitors of the human lineage. In contrast, the bottleneck couple is unique for different reasons of almost no relevance to theology. Scientists should not foist scientific criteria for uniqueness onto the theological discourse.

## The Twist on Human

A more fundamental error plagues this argument. Terms like “sole,” “unique,” “first,” “progenitor,” and “only” are defined in the scientific frame alone; they must _always_ reference the bottleneck couple. No other definition is permitted. Consequently, in an ongoing and unfair mistake, evidence against a single-couple bottleneck is still cited as evidence against RTB’s “sole-genetic progenitor” model.[^11]

[^11]: Interbreeding is excluded by narrowly defining and tight controlling terms like “sole-genetic progenitor.” But many, including Reasons to Believe (RTB), use this term in a different way, allowing for non-Adamic _Neanderthals_ interbreeding with Adamic _Homo sapiens_. RTB defines sole-genetic progenitor so as not to rule out interbreeding. They mean by the term that humans are biologically unique, and we all inherit DNA that enables our unique capacities by direct descent from Adam and Eve. In this way, Adam and Eve are the sole couple from whom we all inherit the DNA that makes us fully human. There may be other evidence against RTB’s model, but it will not come from scientific work that fixates on a single-couple bottleneck.

This is a category error; scientific definitions are read into theological claims. The doctrine of monogenesis does not speak of DNA or esoteric bottlenecks, just humans, and how we arise.

Livingstone observes that St. Augustine essentially _defines_ human as “Adam, Eve, and their descendants.”[^12] In present day, of course, humans are coextensive with all “rational animals” on Earth. Speculation abounds, nonetheless, about non-Adamic beings in the primordial past.[^13]

[^12]: This is precisely the definition of human I recover as one legitimate definition of human. My specific argument for this definition, references historical theology, but focuses on the textual evidence in Scripture for such a definition. Swamidass, _The Genealogical Adam and Eve_.
[^13]: Would Augustine, in particular, think Adam and Eve’s lineage is coextensive with “rational animals” retroactively into the primordial past? This is an interesting question, but entirely outside the contextual scope of both the specific discourse of this quote and the passages in Romans from which he derives his theology.


By _this_ definition, Adam and Eve are the sole couple to sit at the head of the human lineage. Whether or not they are a genetic bottleneck, they would still be the _first_ and _only_ couple of the human lineage, _progenitors_ situated _solely_ and _uniquely_ at the headwaters of all humanity.

## A World of Screws

These are the best scientific arguments against monogenesis. They hinge entirely on hidden theological assumptions, tightly controlled vocabulary, and strategic scientific omissions. The fixation on negation, on trumpeting evolutionary conflict with monogenesis, increasingly looks like a hammer in a world of screws. Hammering in a screw might work at times, but damage is done. Hammering out a screw, it seems, is nearly impossible.

# A Constructive Voice on Race

Much as scientists were wrong about an eternal universe, we were also wrong about monogenesis. If Adam and Eve are real people in a real past, all of us descend from them. In an epic twist, evolutionary science vindicates the doctrine of monogenesis.

Are we now at a turning point?

The history of origins aids us, unscrewing several false assumptions about the monogenesis tradition. To be sure, this history thrusts us headfirst into difficult questions about race and racism. This history is ugly. It must be reckoned with care.

But there is a payoff. Origins, once again, can bring us to the grand question: what does it mean to be human? We should engage the difficult questions of race and justice in a fallen world.

In our moment, I see opportunity in recovering monogenesis. In doing so, we might also recover our theological voice on race. If Adam and Eve are real, then we are all bound together as their sons and daughters.

May we proclaim this truth anew, this time with scientists too. “We are one blood, one family, one race: the human race.”
