When I was a student, I went through a period of several months where I struggled intensely with what evolution implied about human nature and the purpose (or lack thereof) of our existence. One of the issues at the heart of my struggle was the principle of (what lay people sometimes refer to as) the ‘survival of the fittest.’[^1] With a limited understanding of what this meant, I concluded that, if evolution were true and our psychologies are somehow the product of evolution, then we must ultimately be selfish. As the esteemed Mr. Richard Dawkins once wrote, “Be warned that if you wish...to build a society in which individuals cooperate generously and unselfishly towards a common good, you can expect little help from biological nature...because we are born selfish.”[^2]

[^1]: Modern biologists seem to much prefer the term ‘natural selection’, as opposed to ‘survival of the fittest.’ Here I retain the use of ‘survival of the fittest’ as many seem to intuitively understand what it means.

As my training progressed and I learned more about human nature and evolution, I recognized that my initial understanding was incomplete. It’s certainly true that there are abundant examples of humans behaving in terribly selfish ways. But there are also abundant examples from the human race of genuine altruism, cooperation, and kindness. How did nature create us to be so kind if evolution favors selfishness? There are several potential ways that this may have come about, but the most elegant and compelling has to do with what biologists call the ‘levels of selection.’ The issue of the levels of selection essentially turns ‘survival of the fittest’ into a question: survival of the fittest what? Are we talking about a survival of the fittest individual, or a survival of the fittest family or even group? The level of selection has critical bearing on the types of social traits that would have been favored (and thus, wired into our collective psyche).

I’ll try to drive this point home with a brief story. In 1864 (coincidentally, the same year that biologist Spencer Herbert coined the phrase ‘survival of the fittest’), two ships wrecked at the same time and place.[^3] The setting was the Auckland Islands, located some 300 miles south of mainland New Zealand. (The archipelago is sufficiently large that the two groups never learned of one another’s presence.) The first ship was led by a man named Captain Thomas Musgrave. Through incredible ingenuity and resourcefulness, all of the crew from Musgrave’s ship survived. The second ship was captained by George Dalgarno. Unfortunately, most of the crew from Dalgarno’s ship died. What was the key difference? Musgrave’s crew formed a remarkably cohesive and cooperative group. This was epitomized within the first minutes of shipwrecking, when Captain Musgrave himself carried an injured man on his back as he swam through the torrential waves to the safety of the shore. Dalgarno’s group, on the other hand, took an every-man-for-himself approach. This was exemplified when, within a day of shipwrecking, the group left a wounded man behind to die on the shore as they searched further inland for food.

[^3]: Here I lean heavily on Nicholas Christakis’ analysis of this remarkable story, as found in his book [_Blueprint: The Evolutionary Origins of a Good Society_](https://www.amazon.com/Blueprint-Evolutionary-Origins-Good-Society/dp/0316230049/) (New York: Little Brown, Spark, 2019).

The remarkable story of the twin shipwrecks at the Auckland Islands demonstrates how, in some circumstances, survival would have been benefitted by cooperation, not selfishness. It’s easy to imagine similar scenarios in our ancient past where prosocial tendencies (altruism, kindness, trust, and loyalty) would have increased the chance of survival. Two biologists, Edward O. Wilson and David Sloan Wilson, sum up this principle with perfect brevity and clarity: “Selfishness beats altruism within groups. Altruistic groups beat selfish groups. Everything else is commentary.”[^4]

So, in our evolution, which ‘level of selection’ was most important? Was it the survival of the fittest individual, or a survival of the fittest family/group?[^5] My conclusion is that both of these levels were important at different times in our ancient evolutionary history. This has left us with competing dispositions. On the one hand, we have immense capacity for selfishness, hate, and even violence. But we also have a deep capacity for altruism, love, and cooperation. This is what I call the dual potential of human nature.

[^5]: Here I lump together family and group for brevity. In reality, several biologists continue to debate whether group selection played a significant role in human evolution (though mostly affirm kin selection, or survival of the fittest family). A seeming minority doubt the existence of kin selection but affirm the veracity of group selection (see Martin Nowak’s work). Virtually all biologists would agree that natural selection (survival of the fittest) operated (at least in part) on some level above that of the individual.

This view of human nature helps us escape the quagmire that philosophers, economists, and other scientists have been stuck in for centuries. Are we selfish or altruistic? Are humans aggressive or prone to cooperate? Are we monogamous or promiscuous? The stunning answer seems to be...yes. Or at least we have the potential to be all of these things. This helps explain the huge variation in human nature—our great “moral range”—that has been chronicled throughout history.

So, how does this fit in with an overall purpose of existence to the human experience? The answer to this question involves the principle of free will. Life is willful. No one thinks of him or herself as the passive follower of the brain or body. We each consider ourselves, at least to some degree, “in charge” and free to direct and control our attention, thought, speech, and action.[^6] When we combine the principle of free will with the dual potential of human nature, it would seem that the purpose of our existence (or at least one such purpose) is to choose between these competing natures. To choose between altruism and selfishness, cooperation and aggression, love and lust. A fundamental purpose of our existence is to choose between the good and evil inherent within us. Life is a test. This is a principle that has been espoused by so many of the world’s religions.

[^6]: I am aware that some scientists believe that free will is an illusion. But I think the psychological and biological evidence is clear that, at least on some level, humans are free and responsible agents.
