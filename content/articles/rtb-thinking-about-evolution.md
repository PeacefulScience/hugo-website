The dialogue about human origins continues with Hugh Ross's organization, *Reasons to Believe* (RTB). Last year, we participated in a workshop with [RTB on Human Origins](https://peacefulscience.org/human-origins-rtb-workshop/). More recently, Dr. [Fazale Rana and I were interviewed by Sean McDowell](https://discourse.peacefulscience.org/t/mcdowell-rana-and-swamidass-livestreamed-on-sunday/10289). Today we discuss the new book, *[Thinking About Evolution: 25 Questions Christians Want Answered](https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-about-Evolution-Questions-Christians-ebook/dp/B08MYF1SL5/?tag=swamidass-20)*.

{{< amazon `B08MYF1SL5` >}}

This old earth creationist book is co-authored by four scholars at RTB: Fazale Rana, AJ Roberts, [the late Sue Dykes](https://reasons.org/about/sue-dykes), and Mark Perez.

Perhaps the most interesting chapter of the book is the last one, written by AJ Roberts. She asks the question, "*What if Big 'E' Evolution is True?*" Her answer is thoughtful, surprising, and moves the conversation forward. [RTB generously made this chapter available to us](https://www.patreon.com/posts/46389196), and I hope you take a moment to read it.

I highly recommend this book, so much so that I am proud to endorse it. This endorsement speaks for itself, and sets the state for the conversation today with Dr. Fazale Rana.

> Though I am a scientist who affirms evolutionary science, I still found much with which to agree in *Thinking About Evolution*. Progressive creationists agree the earth is old, but they maintain reservations about macroevolution. Genuinely considering the possibility they might be wrong, it is significant that the book explains how evolutionary science could be consistent with Scripture. Dr. Roberts and her colleagues, moreover, have a laudable record of adjusting their views in response to evidence. Perhaps some version of their theology of nature could be consistent with the evidence. Their scientific objections to evolution, also, deserve to be engaged with seriousness and rigor. For all these reasons, even secular scientists should read this book; it is a good faith starting point for meaningful dialogue.
