Greg Cootsona is Project Co-director of Science for the Church and Lecturer in Religious Studies and Humanities at California State University at Chico. He formerly served nearly 18 years as associate pastor for young adult ministries and adult discipleship in New York and Chico, California. Greg studied comparative literature at U.C. Berkeley and theology at Princeton Theological Seminary (M.Div.), the Universities of Tübingen and Heidelberg, as well as Berkeley’s Graduate Theological Union (the latter where he received his Ph.D.). He is the author of seven books, including [*Mere Science and Christian Faith*](https://www.amazon.com/Mere-Science-Christian-Faith-Bridging/dp/0830838147), [*C.S. Lewis and the Crisis of a Christian*](https://www.amazon.com/C-S-Lewis-Crisis-Christian/dp/0664239404), and most recently, [*Negotiating Science and Religion in America*](https://www.amazon.com/Negotiating-Science-Religion-America-Present/dp/1138067393). Greg is passionate about the power of connecting mainstream science with “mere Christianity.”
