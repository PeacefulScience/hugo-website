The question of the historicity of the biblical Adam and Eve remains a crucial issue for contemporary Christians. The range of Christian beliefs regarding the origin of humanity impacts their understanding of human identity, human uniqueness, and the human condition. Theologically, the historicity of Adam and Eve speaks to original sin, redemption, and God’s plan and purpose for humanity.

Perspectives on the Historical Adam and Eve delves into the anthropological and theological dimensions that shape our understanding of humanity. In an essay-and-response model, four leading evangelical scholars examine the biblical teachings, scientific evidence, and theological and practical implications of each view. 

As part of the Perspectives series, this volume presents four distinct positions in dialogue, moderated by volume editor Kenneth Keathley and with an afterword by S. Joshua Swamidass: 

- the Non-Historical Adam and Eve View (Kenton L. Sparks) 
- the Mytho-Historical Adam View (William Lane Craig) 
- the Genealogical Adam and Eve Model (Andrew Loke) 
- the Recent Adam and Eve View (Marcus R. Ross) 

The essays and responses engage with contemporary research into the genealogical Adam and Eve and well as the advancing biblical studies of the Genesis narratives of Adam and Eve as part of the primeval history of Genesis 1–11. Professors, students, pastors, and interested lay readers are invited to join an ongoing and important conversation that has the power to shape their beliefs about human identity, redemption, and God's divine plan.
