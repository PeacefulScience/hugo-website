February 20th, one year ago in 2023, Michael S. Heiser passed into the unseen realm. Many of us still feel his absence. Heiser’s scholarship left a mark. But he was more than merely a scholar. 

>  Simply, as the scholar Carmen Imes puts it, Heiser “singlehandedly changed what it was possible for a biblical scholar to accomplish.” Before Heiser, who could have known that academic and detailed exposition of weirdest parts of the Bible would gather a world-wide audience of so many?

> Heiser was also courageous, willing to advance controversial ideas he believed would serve the Church. [It certainly took courage to discussed with me](https://nakedbiblepodcast.com/podcast/naked-bible-356-the-genealogical-adam-and-eve-part-1/), on his podcast, [how evolution can be consistent with his reading of Genesis](https://nakedbiblepodcast.com/podcast/naked-bible-357-the-genealogical-adam-and-eve-part-2/). Then, at an academic conference, [he went on to present a detailed defense of God having created people outside the Garden, alongside Adam and Eve.](https://peacefulscience.org/prints/aar-heiser-gae/)  In doing so, Heiser legitimized constructive dialogue with science, still holding fast to the supernatural, even in the troubled waters of the origins debate.


We asked him a weird question, just before he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer.

> “What would you do if your daughter wanted to date a Neanderthal,” I once asked Michael S. Heiser, the great biblical scholar. I meant a literal Neanderthal. This was a thought experiment, in which the thick-browed cave man was not fully human, and not in the image of God. 
>
> Admittedly, this is a weird question. The easiest response would be to sniff, reject the premise, and move on.
>
> But Heiser was up for the question. He was, after all, the scholar of the weird. Thinking of Genesis 6:1-4 and Psalm 82, Heiser often said “if it is weird, it is important.” So, how would he respond to this weird question?
