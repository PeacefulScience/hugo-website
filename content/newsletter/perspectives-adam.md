After a long wait, it is here. We are excited to announce the publication of the book, [*Perspectives on the Historical Adam and Eve*](https://peacefulscience.org/books/perspectives-adam). This book is a dialogue between four leading evangelical scholars, exploring the theological and scientific questions surrounding the historical Adam and Eve. 

This book moves the dialogue forward, and is a must read for anyone interested in the conversation. 

Currently, there are four basic approaches that Evangalicals are taking to the historical Adam and Eve, and reflecting how the origins debate has reconfigured in the last few years: 

1. No-Adam and Eve  (Kenton L. Sparks)
2. An Ancient Genealogical Adam and Eve (William Lane Craig)
3. A Recent Genealogical Adam and Eve  (Andrew Loke)
4. Creationist (Marcus R. Ross)

In many ways, each of these scholars is responding to the work of S. Joshua Swamidass' [*The Genealogical Adam and Eve.*](https://peacefulscience.org/books/genealogical-adam-eve) So it is fitting that Swamidass authored the afterword  for this book. After being presented at the Evangelical Theological Society last year, portions of this afterword were [adapted and published last month in *Christianity Today*](https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2024/july-august/theological-unity-diversity-lausanne-covenant.html?share=XKFDUAPDZhUSBHxkS4mHMx%2fn04DYp%2fZB&utm_medium=widgetsocial).
