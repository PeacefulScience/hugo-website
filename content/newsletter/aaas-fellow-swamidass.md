S. Joshua Swamidass, founder of *Peaceful Science,* is elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the world’s largest general scientific society and publisher of the Science family of journals. Election to be a AAAS fellow is among the highest honors in science.

In the words of the AAAS, he is being recognized,

> For distinguished contributions to the field of deep learning in computational biology, and for extraordinary public outreach promoting an understanding of science among communities of faith.

As [Washington University explains further](https://medicine.wustl.edu/news/swamidass-named-aaas-fellow/),

> His public outreach advances understanding of human evolution and of race and racism within communities of faith. His 2019 book, “The Genealogical Adam and Eve,” proposes a reading of the biblical story of Adam and Eve that is consistent with evolutionary science. The book also explains scientific problems with the theory of polygenesis, the debunked idea that different races of people arose independently in different parts of the world. This discredited theory contributes to systemic racism by articulating inaccurate and disproven ideas about inherent racial differences.
>
> He also served as an adviser for the exhibit “Scripture and Science: Our Universe, Ourselves, Our Place” at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C. The exhibit, which runs through January 2024, explores the Bible’s role in the historical relationship between science and religion.


The emphasis on his public outreach is significant validation of *Peaceful Science*, including our work on Adam and Eve.
